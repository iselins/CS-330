# Each of the sentences below are followed by a set of related instructions.  
# After each instruction, add your code that does what's being asked, as well as
# a print statement that shows your work. Don't forget to print new lines as well,
# or your output will be a mess!
#
# For example:
$s0="This is a test";
print $s0."\n";

#1) Write a regular expression that replaces the 's' characters with 'z's
$s0=~s/s/z/g;
print $s0."\n";

#2) Write a regular expression and if statement that checks if T is the first letter
if ($s0=~/^T/){
  print "It starts with 'T'!\n";
}

#3) collect all the words and put them in an array, then put the first word in a variable and print it
@array=($s0=~m/([A-Za-z]+ )/g);
print @array;
print "\n";
$firstword=$array[0];
print "The first word is: $firstword\n";

#4 split the sentence into an array of individual words called @words and use a foreach loop to print it
#  a foreach loop in Perl looks like this:
#     foreach $var (@arrah){
#        (your code here)
#     }
@words = split(" ",$s0);
foreach $word (@words){
    print $word."\n";
}

# =~/a.*b/ #looks for strings that start with a followed by any letter any number of times and ends with b (abcbeb ends at abcbeb)
# =~/a.*?b/ #looks for strings that start with a followed by any letter any number of times OR 0 times and ends with b (abcbeb ends at ab)

print"\n\n***************** Mary *****************\n\n";

#######################################################


$s1="Mary was born on September 17, 1986";

#1) Write a regular expression and if statement that checks if the name "Mary" is in the sentence.
if ($s1=~/Mary/){
    print "1) I found Mary!\n";
}

#2) Write a regular expression to replace "Mary" with "Margeret"
$s1=~s/Mary/Margeret/g;
print "2) ".$s1."\n";

#3) Write a regular expression and if statement that checks if the sentence contains a 4 digit number.
if ($s1=~/[0-9]{4}/){
    print("3) There is a 4 digit number in the statement.\n");

#4) Write a regular expression to extract that number into a variable $byear and print it in the sentence "The person was born in $byear."
@byear=($s1=~m/([0-9]{4})/g);

print"\n\n***************** Dog ******************\n\n";

#1) Write a regular expression to match the word "dog", but not the name "Dog";

#2) Save the output from this match into an array and make sure it is not matching anything else (i.e. print the array).
@dog=($s2=~m/\bdog\b/g);
print("2) These are the contents of the array: ");

#3) Write a regular expression to match "dog" and "Dog" using a flag (see the cheat sheet).
while($s2=~/\bdog\b/ig){

}

#4) Write a regular expression to match "dog" or "fog";

#2) Write a regular expression to extract all numbers, store them in an array, then print the array.

print"\n\n************** Whitespace **************\n\n";

#2) Write a regular expression to print only the text from the first "begin" to the first "end"
print "2) ";
@between=($s5=~/begin.*?end/g);

#3) Write a regular expression to extract all of the text between "begin"s and "end"s into an array.
print "3) ";

print "2) \$fdate: ";

$month=@fdate[0];
$day=@fdate[1];
$year=@fdate[2];
print "3) \$month: ".$month."\t\$day: ".$day."\t\$year: ".$year."\n";

#4) convert the date to computer date format year-month-day where month and day always have 2 digits
#   save the result in $compdate
# hint: you can concatenate a string and a number and get back a string
$compdate=$year."-".$month."-".$day;
print "4) ".$compdate."\n";

#5) print the new date
